One way to clear float is just add one empty element

index.html: <div class="clear"></div>

style.css:
.clear {
  clear: both;
}

One trick to solve float problem called "clearfix heck"

instead of adding a empty element just add one calss="clearfix" to the collapsed height elementpseudo elements i.e. after and before by default are inline element and clearing floats like this trick works on bloack level elements

.clearfix::after {
  clear: both;
  content: "";
  display: block;
}
