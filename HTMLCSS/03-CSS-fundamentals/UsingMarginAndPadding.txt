xyz {
  padding-left: 40px;
  padding-right:40px;
  ## shorthand (top-bottom) (left-right)
  padding: 20px 40px;
  margin-bottom:10px
}

## If we want no margin in the last li item after giving margin to all li items
li:last-child {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}

## Global Reset (Reset all default margins and paddings and set them to 0)

if apply on body element it only set to body element as margin is not the property that is related to text which gets inherited to its chlid elements
body {
  margin:0;
}

## Instead if we want the margin to be applied to every single element then use universal selector
* {
  margin:0;
  padding:0;
}

Global reset can remove the bullet and numbered points s we have to give some space at the left side to show them for example margin-left:50px

## Margins betwenn elements gets overlapped i.e. collapsing margins bigger element's margin overlapps the smaller margin

## Quick Recap
1.Whenever need space inside an element which is very useful when there is a backgroung color or a border on the element then always use padding
2. To create space outside the element or to create space between multiple elements always use margin
3. In case we need to add vertical space then most of the time stick to margin-bottom
