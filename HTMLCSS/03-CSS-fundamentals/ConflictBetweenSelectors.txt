## In css file
.author {
  fonr-style: Italic;
  font-size: 10px;
}

#author-text {
  font-size: 20px;
}

p,
li {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: #444444
  font-size: 22px;
}

There are multiple selectors selecting the same element. Which one of them applies?
All of them. All the rules and properties are applied!

But there are conflicting font-size declarations! is it 18px, or 20px, or 22px?

Highest priority to lowest priority

Declaration marked "!important"
Inlinre style(style attribute in HTML)
ID(#) selector, for multiple ID selectors last selector in code applies
Class(.) or pseudo-class(:) selector, same like ID in case of multiple Class selector
Element selector(p, div, li, etc.), same like ID and Class in case of multiple
Universal selector(*)

There is an ID selector (#author-text), so for the conflicting font-size property, this is the selector that applies


## Specificity tells priority
(1, 0, 0) has more priority then (0, 1, 0)
