## Add Dimensions to elements using height and width property

img-size {
  width:800px;
  height:auto;
}

## height:auto It will fix the aspect ration back to the original for the image

### Specifying the height and setting it to auto is only neccessary if taht height is already specified before in HTML

Incase we don't specify any image dimensios in HTML then if we set the height or the width using CSS the other one will automatically adapt in order to account for the original aspect ratio of the image

if we use % instead of px for example width:100% means the percentage is usually the percentage of the width of the parent container. So now when we change the size of the window then the size of image will always stay at 100% of its parent.

It will adapt the size with respect to the screen change i.e. responsive design
