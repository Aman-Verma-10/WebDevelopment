Child element can never be wider than the parent element

.container {
  width: 700px;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}

## Shorthand
margin: 0 auto;

## here margin auto means that the margin on the left needs to be same then the margin on the right side. They should both be calculated automatically by the browser

So the container will look centered inside of the body or inside of the browser
