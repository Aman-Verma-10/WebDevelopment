Pseudo elements are essentially elements that don't exist in HTML but that we can still select and style in CSS
Common examples are: first letter of a paragraph or the 1st line of paragraph, etc.

h1::first-letter {
  
}

Here pseudo elements are written with two colons(::) whereas pseudo classes are written with single colon(:)

#### pseudo element Line selector
p::first-line {
  color: red;
}

#### adjacent element selector or adjacent sibling selector

adjacent siblings are actually the very next element in the same container parent

/* adjacent sibling selector */
### color red to 1st line of all paragraph whose very previous sibling is h3

h3 + p::first-line {
  /* color: red; */
}

### most important pseudo elements: before and after

after pseudo element creates a pseudo element that will automatically be the very first child of the selected element

By default pseudo element is an inline element

h2 {
  /* background-color: orange; */
  position: relative;
}

/* pseudo after element */
h2::after {
  content: "TOP";
  background-color: #ffe70e;
  color: #444;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: bold;
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 5px 10px;
  position: absolute;
  top: -10px;
  right: -25px;
}
